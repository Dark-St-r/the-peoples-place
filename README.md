## Feedback and Learnings

### Filecoin
We had intended to deploy a server but couldnâ€™t spare the time. We're looking forward to exploring this in the future.

### Polygon
Using the Polygon ID, we explored various avenues including privacy, whistle-blowing, and contracts. It opened up future prospects to develop more secure and user-friendly platforms.

### Lens
Lens was utilized to validate user identities, proving crucial to user authentication within our system.

### Near
Our aim was to integrate Near, but various challenges including issues with Infura hindered our progress, and it stopped working before the wallet integration could be completed.

### zkevm
zkevm was a significant component in our marketplace, optimizing the execution of EVM smart contracts and allowing for a more seamless and efficient transaction experience.
